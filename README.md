# EV-Charging-Stations-Finder
This was a small-team project, focussed on bringing accessibility to electric vehicle owners, allowing for customizable trip planning across America.

Our app was hosted via EC2 and DynamoDB and developed under AGILE and Scrum methodologies, focussing on professional deliverables and industry-standard software engineering principles


**SETUP AND RUNNING CODE**

The EC2 and backend were both shut down due to operational costs, but the code can be ran via localhost using React and Vite.

1) Download and unpack the zip file
2) Open folder in Visual Studio
3) Initialization command - npm install
4) Run command - npm run dev
